Different hopper types are available: bronze and iron.
The pieces are found in the hammer crafting tab,
bronze hoppers cost 3 Wood + 1 Bronze Nail, iron hoppers cost 3 Wood + 1 Iron Nail.
Both have the same transfer speed but the bronze hopper has only one slot while the iron hopper has three.

Filter hopper: these can be used to automate item routing.
They will always hold on to the last item in every slot.
